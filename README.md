# Kerberos-Token-Security
This project is about Securing WSO2 Services with Kerberos Token-based Security.

Kerberos is used to authenticate Systems or users within a network. But when we need to access services outside network boundaries, we need to authenticate users with internal credentials. In such cases, we can use this scenario.

In here we set up and configure the Kerberos Token-based Security using Identity server and Micro Integrator products.

1.Set up KDC server

2.Configure Local Machine for Kerberos

3.Configure Micro Integrator for Kerberos

4.Set up the JAVA client to invoke service

You can find more information about configuring the products from this article -> https://asarakumarasena94.medium.com/securing-wso2-services-with-kerberos-token-based-security-79916c91e8e9
